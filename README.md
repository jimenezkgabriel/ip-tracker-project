## <a name="reflection"></a>Reflection
Development Process:
* This project was well drafted to simulate a complete software development lifecycle. It has requirements in the form of the project overview found in the Per Scholas lessons site, it has wireframing as a requirement that I worked on in Figma, it has a Trello board that I had to create tasks to do and actively dragged and dropped those cards in each of the categories: To Do, Doing, Done, as well as additional categories; it has the actual development from everything we've learned so far, it needs to include documentation in the form of this readme, and it even has deployment, just like a development lifecycle. 

Challenges faced:
